- **Name:**  urn:x-vsf:tag:tr-09-2:booking-list/v1.0
  - **Description:** Booking List tag that can be used to indicate that an NMOS resource is part of one or more TR-09-2 bookings.
  - **Proponent:** [VSF](https://www.vsf.tv/)

- **Name:**  urn:x-vsf:tag:tr-09-2:current-booking/v1.0

  - **Proponent:** [VSF](https://www.vsf.tv/)

This document describes an application of the AMWA IS-04 `tags` structures to enable control systems to identify NMOS resources that are being shared across a facility boundary as described in the VSF TR-09-2 specification.

## Introduction

The aim of the TR-09-2 booking tags is to facilitate the sharing of NMOS resources between two independent media facilities.

The tags contain information that allows an NMOS resource to be identified and matched to information defined during an earlier booking process.

This booking process takes place between the facility offering the shared resource and the facility consuming the shared resource, as defined in the VSF TR-09-2 specification document.

Two TR-09-2 tags are defined: the `booking-list` tag and the `current-booking` tag.

When an NMOS resource is to be shared with another facility, the facility offering the shared resource MUST include these tags in the JSON of the NMOS resource at the point it is made available at the facility edge.

## Booking List URN

The booking list URN `urn:x-vsf:tag:tr-09-2:booking-list/v1.0` defines a list of bookings associated with the shared NMOS resource.

```json
"tags": {
   "urn:x-vsf:tag:tr-09-2:booking-list/v1.0": [
      "{booking-id1}:{resource-id1}[:{label1}]",
      "{booking-id2}:{resource-id2}[:{label2}]"
   ]
}
```

Where

| Parameter | Description | Values |
| --------- | ----------- | ------ |
| booking-id1 | A string that defines a unique identifier for a first booking | ^[-_a-zA-Z0-9]+$ (case insensitive alphanumeric + hyphen and underscore) |
| resource-id1 | A string that defines a unique identifier for the NMOS resource within the first booking | ^[-_a-zA-Z0-9]+$ (case insensitive alphanumeric + hyphen and underscore) |
| label1 | Optional string that gives a user-friendly label for the NMOS resource within the first booking | ^[-_a-zA-Z0-9 ]+$ (case insensitive alphanumeric + hyphen, underscore and space) |
| booking-id2 | A string that defines a unique identifier for a second booking | ^[-_a-zA-Z0-9]+$ (case insensitive alphanumeric + hyphen and underscore) |
| resource-id2 | A string that defines a unique identifier for the NMOS resource within the second booking | ^[-_a-zA-Z0-9]+$ (case insensitive alphanumeric + hyphen and underscore) |
| label2 | Optional string that gives a user-friendly label for the NMOS resource within the second booking | ^[-_a-zA-Z0-9 ]+$ (case insensitive alphanumeric + hyphen, underscore and space) |
| etc. | | |

The colon character, `:`, is reserved and MUST not be used in any of the parameters listed.

As defined in the VSF TR-09-1 specification:
 - the `booking-id` SHOULD be provided by the facility consuming the shared resource
 - the `resource-id` and `label` SHOULD be provided by the facility offering the shared resource
 - the `resource-id` MUST be unique to the TR-09-2 booking tags and MUST not be the same as the NMOS UUID associated with the resource (from the resource's `id` field)
 - the same `resource-id` MAY be used for a given NMOS resource across multiple bookings
 
## Current Booking URN

The current booking URN `urn:x-vsf:tag:tr-09-2:current-booking/v1.0` defines the currently active booking for the shared NMOS resource. If none of the bookings in the booking list is currently active, then the list MUST be empty.

```json
"tags": {
   "urn:x-vsf:tag:tr-09-2:current-booking/v1.0": [
      "{booking-id}"
   ]
}
```

Where

| Parameter | Description | Values |
| --------- | ----------- | ------ |
| booking-id | The currently active booking from the booking list | ^[-_a-zA-Z0-9]+$ (Case insensitive alphanumeric + hyphen and underscore), MUST match one of the booking-id values in the booking list |

No more than one `booking-id` MUST be listed in the current booking.
